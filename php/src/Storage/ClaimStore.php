/**
 * The storage PORT the consuming app implements (medipim provides a DBAL adapter; the package ships
 * {@see InMemoryClaimStore} as the reference + test double). Dependency-free: every method speaks
 * plain arrays/scalars, so the package never reaches for Doctrine.
 *
 * The model is lane-agnostic and per-key (it scales without a global snapshot blob):
 *   - `events`    — the append-only log, the system of record (one row per event, `seq` = offset).
 *   - per-key snapshot — each surrogate key's current code-set + current claim view ({@see saveKey}).
 *   - `members`   — the code -> key resolution index (the ledger, as queryable rows).
 *   - `redirects` — old key -> new key after a merge (clients holding a stale key resolve forward).
 *   - `lane_seq`  — the per-lane mint counter, so surrogate keys are globally unique within a lane.
 *   - backfill idempotency — a per-(entity, fingerprint) marker.
 *
 * All writes by {@see ClaimIngest} run inside {@see transactionally} (the single-writer lock); the
 * key is lane-qualified (`SK_`/`SUB_`/`DSC_`/`MED_`), so `lane` is always derivable from it.
