defmodule Api.DryRun do
  @moduledoc """
  `POST /v1/dry-run` (gr-rlq): the FULL claims pipeline — validate → canonicalize → cluster →
  reconcile — run against the current state with NOTHING committed, shaped as the migration
  report: the funnel artifact ("1,400 conflicts, 230 merge candidates") plus per-item drill-down.

  `Api.Writes.simulate/2` runs the exact `claims/1` pipeline uncommitted, so the verdicts here
  are byte-for-byte what a real `POST /v1/claims` of the same batch would produce; this module
  only projects the would-be state and renders. Sections (every key always present):

    * `validation`       — per-index contract violations (what `/v1/claims` would 422 with).
    * `submission`       — the exact response `/v1/claims` WOULD return (accepted / skipped /
                           events / flagged); `null` when validation rejected the batch.
    * `mints`            — keys this batch would mint, with their codes.
    * `merge_candidates` — open merge proposals in the WOULD-BE state (the over-merge guard
                           gates these — established keys never auto-merge); `suspect: true`
                           when a key is bridged solely by barcode-grade codes (reusable GS1
                           codes — weak evidence, mirroring `LegacyXref`'s guard); `new: true`
                           marks the proposals THIS batch raises.
    * `conflicts`        — attribute contradictions per `(key, field)` dimension, with every
                           source's candidate value; `counts.conflicts_by_field` rolls them up
                           per dimension.
    * `code_collisions`  — variants whose grouping claims point at more than one product.
    * `steward_queue`    — the undecidables: every open item a steward would have to work
                           (merge proposals + attribute ties + collisions, minus anything
                           already resolved).
