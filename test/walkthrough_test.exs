# test/walkthrough_test.exs — a guided tour of the golden-record model.
#
#   Run:  mix test test/walkthrough_test.exs
#
# Read top to bottom. Many sources each make claims about products; the engine
# answers one question: which claims describe the SAME real product? Identity is
# re-derived from the CODES a source carries — never from who the source is, and
# never from a legacy grouping.
#
#   Part 1 builds the model from first principles — no medipim, no legacy.
#   Part 2 shows the legacy medipim history is just one more source of claims.
#
# (This is the executable spec for bead gr-ccf. The Part-2 French scenario is the
#  RED TARGET: it is @tag :skip until gr-6k4 teaches the engine the French codes.)
