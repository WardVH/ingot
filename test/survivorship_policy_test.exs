# test/survivorship_policy_test.exs — gr-6y2: Survivorship is policy-driven (rankings always on).
#
# Proves the engine seam that keeps medipim-specific scoring OUT of the generic core:
#   * %Priority{}  -> tier ranking, unchanged (back-compat).
#   * injected fn  -> context-aware rank (medipim's off-product penalty lives HERE, not in Priority).
# Attribute rankings are ALWAYS applied — there is no "off" for attribute survivorship (the toggle
# we want lives on identity-conflict guarding instead; see test/identity_conflict_explained_test.exs).
