# lib/ingest/code_registry.ex — the single source of medipim product-code knowledge (gr-6k4).
#
# Drives scheme handling from ONE table instead of patching country-by-country. Each medipim
# products_deltas field name maps to {engine_scheme_atom, classification}, where classification
# tells ClaimMapping how to use the code:
#
#   :identity     — a national/GTIN code that BRIDGES products in clustering (cnk, cip_acl7, gtin…).
#   :external_ref — identifies the product in ANOTHER system (cbId/ospId/…). Carried as an
#                   attribute, NEVER bridges (the over-merge/bridging-policy question is its own
#                   bead, gr-ose; default here is "do not bridge").
#   :attribute    — a non-identifying classification (hsCode customs, pbs reimbursement class).
#   :entity_id    — medipim's own id (productId) == the legacy entity; not a code claim at all.
#
# The roster was extracted from medipimv2's ProductIdentifierInterface value objects +
# ProductMetaFieldBuilder / ProductCodeFactory (see docs/plans/2026-06-08-product-code-registry-design.md).
# Adding a market later is a data change here, not a code change.
#
# The engine atom — NOT the medipim field name — is what Codes canonicalizes and what clustering
# bridges on. The GTIN family (ean/gtin/eanGtin*/upc*/…) all collapse to :gtin; national codes
# keep their own atom. The only field-name ≠ canonical-code mismatch is cipOrAcl7 -> :cip_acl7.
