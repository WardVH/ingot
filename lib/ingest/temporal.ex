# lib/ingest/temporal.ex — the temporal pass: identity timeline + bitemporal golden as-of (gr-a2j).
#
# T1 of the temporal-pass epic (gr-nh0), the first post-PoC follow-up promised as "Temporal pass
# (follow-up, not v1)" in docs/plans/2026-06-05-legacy-history-ingest-design.md and designed in
# docs/plans/2026-06-09-temporal-pass-design.md. PURELY ADDITIVE: it touches neither the engine
# (golden_record_core.ex) nor any v1 ingest module. It is a SECOND fold over the very same claims
# `ClaimMapping.build/1` already produces — only the fold changes.
#
# WHY A SECOND FOLD ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# v1 (`Rederivation` -> `GoldenRecords`) folds each legacy listing to its FINAL code-set — a
# snapshot — and projects via the Date-free `Catalog.project` (recency by integer `order`),
# precisely because the legacy envelopes carry INTEGER Unix-epoch timestamps and the engine's
# `History.*` / `Api.*` Date filters raise on integers. A snapshot answers "what is this product
# now?" but discards WHEN identity changed. The temporal pass recovers that: an entity that ends up
# merged may only have BECOME one product over time.
#
# THE BOUNDARY DATE CONVERSION (the load-bearing choice) ───────────────────────────────────────
# Rather than temporalize the engine, we convert epoch -> `Date` ONCE here, at the ingest boundary,
# so the engine's tested `History.project_as_of/3` runs UNCHANGED over a fully Date-typed log
# (golden_record_core.ex stays Date-pure — zero blast radius on existing demos/tests). Each claim's
# integer `recorded_at`/`valid_from` becomes `DateTime.from_unix!(epoch) |> DateTime.to_date()`.
#
# UNI-TEMPORAL — `valid_from = recorded_at`. Legacy deltas carry a SINGLE clock, so we collapse to
# one axis: `project_as_of` ("as known on date D"), not a true two-axis bitemporal grid. Honest to
# the data; the engine's full bitemporal API stays available if a second clock ever appears.
#
# FOLD-FORWARD + STABLE KEYS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# We re-cluster at each distinct date by FOLDING FORWARD, threading the PRIOR ledger into the next
# date's `IdentityLedger.decide/2`. Threading `ledger_prev` is what keeps surrogate keys STABLE
# across time (`decide` continues `next` from the prior ledger and reuses overlapping keys) — the
# whole point: a snapshot-then-diff would reshuffle keys and make the timeline unreadable. This is
# idiomatic — it is exactly what `golden_record_ddd.exs` already does across hand-picked dates. The
# event vocabulary is the engine's existing one (Minted / MembersChanged / Merged / Split) — no new
# event types.
#
# `shared` COMPUTED ONCE — from the FULL history, not per-date. Globally correct: it avoids an early
# reconcile mis-bridging a code before its later reuse is visible.
#
# DAY GRANULARITY does NOT corrupt values. Epoch -> `Date` collapses sub-day deltas onto one
# temporal point, but BOTH same-day updates stay in the log with distinct integer `order`, and
# survivorship picks the winner by `Enum.max_by(.., & &1.order)` — INTEGER `order`, NOT the Date
# (golden_record_core.ex lines 181/210). So same-day updates resolve to the correct END-OF-DAY value
# (the later one wins any shared field); all that is lost is the ability to time-travel to the
# intra-day midpoint. Because resolution keys off `order` not Date, collapsing to days CANNOT change
# any resolved value — which is also why the temporal fold converges to the v1 snapshot at "today"
# (v1's `Catalog.project` uses the same `order`-based recency).
#
# OUTPUT — `temporal_log = date_stamped_claims ++ all_dated_identity_events`, re-`order`-stamped
# monotonic (mirroring v1's `Rederivation.stamp/2`: continue order after the max claim order,
# preserving emission order). The log is fully Date-typed, so the engine's read layer folds it
# unchanged: `golden_as_of/3` is a thin pass-through to `History.project_as_of/3`.
#
# SCOPE BOUNDARY: this bead OWNS only this module. The ExUnit suite (gr-qka, test/ingest/
# temporal_test.exs) and the runnable demo (gr-aqb, temporal_ingest.exs) are SEPARATE beads that
# dispatch after this one lands — creating them here would collide on those files.

  @moduledoc """
  The temporal pass: a second fold over the ingest's claims that recovers *when* identity changed.

  Where v1 (`Rederivation` → `GoldenRecords`) folds each legacy listing to a final snapshot, this
  folds forward across the distinct dates — converting epoch timestamps to `Date`s at the boundary
  and threading the prior ledger so surrogate keys stay stable — producing a fully `Date`-typed
  temporal log that the engine's `History.project_as_of/3` reads unchanged. See the file header
  above for the full design rationale.
  """

  @doc """
  Run the temporal pass over a list of `%HistoryEnvelope{}`s.

  Builds claims via `ClaimMapping.build/1`, converts their integer-epoch timestamps to `Date`s at
  the boundary, then folds forward across the distinct dates — threading the prior ledger so
  surrogate keys stay stable — emitting *dated* identity events.

  Returns `%{log: temporal_log, timeline: [identity events], ledger: %IdentityLedger{}}`, where:

    * `log` — the temporal event log (`date-stamped claims ++ dated identity events`), re-`order`-
      stamped monotonic and fully `Date`-typed, so the engine's read layer folds it unchanged. Feed
      it to `golden_as_of/3`.
    * `timeline` — the dated identity events (mint / members-changed / merge / split), sorted by
      `{recorded_at, order}` — *when* identity changed.
    * `ledger` — the final `%IdentityLedger{}` after folding through every date.
