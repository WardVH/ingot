# lib/ingest/rederive.ex — cluster + reconcile the legacy claims into surrogate keys (gr-chq).
#
# Stage 3 of the legacy-medipim ingest, after envelope_loader (gr-n8i) and claim_mapping (gr-beo).
# Per the design (docs/plans/2026-06-05-legacy-history-ingest-design.md, "Ingest pipeline" step 4):
# re-derive identity from the codes themselves — the legacy `entity` is NEVER a clustering input,
# it rides along only as the :grouping claims ClaimMapping already synthesized.
#
# The flow is the loop proven verbatim in claim_mapping_test.exs and every demo:
#
#     live     = Substrate.current(claims)
#     clusters = Cluster.variants(live, shared)   # shared codes are members but never bridge
#     events   = IdentityLedger.decide(IdentityLedger.new(), {:reconcile, clusters, shared, at})
#     ledger   = Enum.reduce(events, IdentityLedger.new(), &IdentityLedger.evolve(&2, &1))
#
# OUTPUT — the re-derived EVENT LOG = `claims ++ identity_events`. The engine's entire read layer
# (Api / PublicId / History) folds a SINGLE time-ordered `log` that holds BOTH the
# %Events.ClaimAsserted{} claims AND the identity events `decide` emits, so this log is foldable
# UNCHANGED by Api.resolve_key/lookup, PublicId.canonical/collisions, History.now, etc. The claims
# are already `order`-stamped by ClaimMapping; we stamp the identity events to CONTINUE after the
# max claim order so Api.changes_since/2 (the cursor-based change feed) sees them in sequence —
# mirroring how the engine sequences a real go-forward log.
#
# SCOPE: this bead produces ONLY the intermediate artifact (log + ledger). It BLOCKS two beads and
# does NOT do their work — gr-0c2 = LegacyXref (legacy ⟷ SK map + relation :stable/:split/:merged),
# gr-8r6 = the golden-record projection (Catalog/Api output). No xref, no relation, no projection.
