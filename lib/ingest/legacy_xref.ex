# lib/ingest/legacy_xref.ex — the durable legacy -> new cross-reference (gr-0c2).
#
# Stage 4b of the legacy-medipim ingest, a fold over the re-derivation output (gr-chq:
# `Rederivation.run/2` / `from_claims/2` -> `%{log, ledger, clusters, shared}`). Per the design
# (docs/plans/2026-06-05-legacy-history-ingest-design.md, "LegacyXref — the durable legacy -> new
# map"): the legacy `entity` was NEVER a clustering input — it rode along only as the :grouping
# claims ClaimMapping synthesized (one per listing-code, `%{code, product: legacy_entity}`). Here
# we read those grouping claims back out and join them against the re-derived surrogate keys to
# answer the migration question: where did every existing legacy `entity` id land, and did it stay
# put (stable), get absorbed with others (merged), or fragment across keys (split)?
#
# OUTPUT — two folds plus a resolver:
#
#   key_to_legacy:  SK   -> sorted-unique [legacy_entity, ...]   (provenance of each surrogate key)
#   legacy_to_key:  ent  -> %{primary: SK, all: [SK, ...], relation: :stable | :split |
#                            {:merged, [other_ent, ...]}}
#   resolve_legacy(xref, ent) -> {:ok, primary, status} | {:error, :unknown_legacy}
#
# `relation` IS the migration diff classification (confirm / merge / split / collision) the design
# promises "for free" — but the diff VIEW / rendering is gr-swc, and the golden-record projection
# (Catalog/Api output) is gr-8r6. This module produces ONLY the maps + resolver; it does not render
# a diff and does not project records.
#
# SPLIT PRIMARY — the engine's split "keep" heuristic, re-implemented here to the design's spec
# (CNK ▸ GTIN spine, then most listings, then lowest key). NOTE: the engine's IdentityLedger has a
# private `has_spine?/1` that only checks `:gtin`; the design wants CNK to outrank GTIN, so we
# compute spine rank ourselves rather than borrow it. "Most listings" = the count of DISTINCT
# grouping-claim sources contributing codes to that key — i.e. how many real org listings the
# surrogate key is backed by (a listing = a (legacy_entity, source) pair, and ClaimMapping stamps
# each grouping claim with its listing `source`).
