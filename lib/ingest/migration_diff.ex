# lib/ingest/migration_diff.ex — the migration-validation diff VIEW (gr-swc).
#
# Stage 4c of the legacy-medipim ingest, AFTER LegacyXref (gr-0c2). The design promises the
# migration diff "for free" because LegacyXref's `legacy_to_key` relation already IS the
# confirm/merge/split classification and `PublicId.collisions(:cnk, log)` already IS the
# hard-invariant (collision) check. This module is ONLY the VIEW: it READS those two existing
# projections and RENDERS them — as a machine JSON form and a human summary string. It changes
# NOTHING about identity, clustering, or the engine; it is a pure fold over data others produced.
#
# CONFIDENCE — the load-bearing distinction a migrator acts on:
#
#   :stable                      -> :confirmed  (1:1)                       confidence :high
#   {:merged, others}            -> :merged     (a national CNK bridged)    confidence :high
#   {:merged, others, :suspect}  -> :merged + needs_review                  confidence :low
#                                   (only a BARCODE bridged — see gr-ose; the cross-org GTIN/EAN
#                                    bridge is weaker evidence than a national code, so a human
#                                    should eyeball it before trusting the merge)
#   :split                       -> :split (the entity FRAGMENTED across keys; list all + primary)
#   PublicId.collisions(:cnk)    -> :collision + needs_review (a CNK on >1 key — an invariant
#                                    VIOLATION, never expected; always surfaces for review)
#
# JSON-SAFETY: codes are engine tuples (`{:cnk, "100"}`) and the built-in `JSON` module cannot
# encode tuples. So findings carry codes as `"scheme:value"` strings and relations as plain maps
# from the start — the report map is JSON-safe by construction, and `to_json/1` is a thin
# `JSON.encode!`. (Atoms encode as strings via the built-in encoder, which is exactly what we want
# for the category/confidence enums.)
#
# SCOPE BOUNDARY: this bead OWNS only this module + its test. It does NOT edit legacy_xref.ex or
# code_registry.ex (gr-ose owns those this wave) — it consumes the `:suspect` relation variant they
# emit purely as input.

  Build the migration-diff report from a re-derivation result `%{log: log, ledger: ledger}` (the
  map returned by `Rederivation.run/2` / `Rederivation.from_claims/2`).

  Internally folds `LegacyXref.build/1`'s `legacy_to_key` and `PublicId.collisions(:cnk, log)` into
  one structured, JSON-safe report:

        needs_review: [finding, ...]         # the suspect merges + CNK collisions, for the summary
      }

      %{category: "confirmed", legacy_entity: ent, keys: ["SK_n"], primary: "SK_n",
