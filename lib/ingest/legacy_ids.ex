# lib/ingest/legacy_ids.ex — legacy-ID continuity for the medipim takeover (gr-twa).
#
# BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY (docs/plans/2026-06-10-medipim-product-api-design.md): every golden
# record answers to a legacy medipim product ID, forever — medipim and everything downstream keeps
# speaking medipim IDs while the engine owns identity underneath.
#
#   * BACKFILLED keys inherit the legacy entity their evidence came from: the ingest synthesizes a
#     grouping claim per (listing, code) with `product: legacy_entity`, so a key's legacy ID is the
#     entity its member codes vote for (most grouping claims wins; ties break to the LOWEST id —
#     deterministic, and the older entity is the one external references most likely use).
#   * NEW keys (post-backfill products, or keys carved out by a steward split) get a freshly
#     ALLOCATED id, above every id ever seen — so it can never collide with a real medipim entity.
#
# Assignment is an EVENT (`Events.LegacyIdAssigned`) in the log — auditable, replayable — never a
# side table. Resolution follows identity: a merged key's legacy id keeps resolving, to the
# SURVIVOR (the absorbed id becomes an alias); a split key keeps its id on the KEPT key and the
# carved-out keys allocate fresh ones on the next `decide/4`.

  `Events.LegacyIdAssigned` for live keys that lack one (inherit from grouping evidence, else
  allocate above the max), `fold/1` projects the current `key => legacy_id` map, and `resolve/2`
  answers a legacy id with the key it lands on TODAY — following merges to the survivor.
